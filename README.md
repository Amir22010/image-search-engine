# Content Based Image Search Engine

Inspired by [Adrian Blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/02/03/building-an-image-search-engine-defining-your-image-descriptor-step-1-of-4/)

I am trying to built a visual search engine, by using your own image you can search other simillar images with just a single click.

There are four steps to built an image search engine
- Defining your descriptor
- Indexing your dataset
- Defining your similarity metric
- Searching
